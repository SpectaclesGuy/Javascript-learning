// Datatypes are basically divided into two:
// Primivite and Non-Primitive(Reference)
// This division is based in the way that how they are stored in the memory

// Primitive :
//      7 types : String, Number, Boolean, Bigint, null, undefined, symbol

// Reference (Non-Primitive):
//      3 types: Array, Objects, Functions

// Javascript is dynamically typed as when declaring a variable we never mention its datatype

// In Javascript, the datatype Number includes both float and integer values

// the data type of all reference datatypes returned by the typeof() function is object, expect for a function,
// in which case it is an object function


// All the datatypes that have not yet discussed will be added earlier


// ********************* MEMORIES ***************************

// Two types of memories, stack and heap.

// All the primitive data types use stack memory.
// All the non-primitive data types use heap memory.

// Primitive -> stack -> copy
// Non-Primitive -> heap -> reference
